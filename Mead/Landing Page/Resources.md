 - Tosna Calculator - [Link](https://www.meadmaderight.com/tosna-calculator) - Used for calculating how much yeast nutrient to add and when to add
 - [ABV Calculator](https://www.brewersfriend.com/abv-calculator/) - Used for calculating the ABV after **INITIAL FERMENTATION ONLY**
 - For Calculating the ABV after back sweetening use this formula
	 - O<sub>V</sub> = Original Volume (oz)
	 - F<sub>V</sub> = Added Volume (oz)
	 - O<sub>A</sub> = Original ABV (from the calculator above)
	 - A<sub>V</sub> = Original Alcohol Volume (oz) = $O_V*(O_A/100)$
	 - F<sub>ABV</sub> = Final ABV = $(A_V/(O_V+F_V))*100$

 - [Kitchen scale](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09R8ZKDGP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) is a life saver, but for nutrient additions you'll need one that's more precise (down to tenth of a gram I think, ex [this](https://www.amazon.com/Weigh-Gram-Digital-Jewelry-Kitchen/dp/B06Y61YW7S))
