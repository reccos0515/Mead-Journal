1/3/25 - Started brew, initial gravity reading 1.094

Actually used 1.8lbs peaches though some of that might be syrup because they were added from cans.

That puts the potential ABV at ~12% which after sweetening would put it around ~10%, close to the 1.10 plan. Needed to increase the honey from the 2 1/4 lbs scaled down from the original recipe to 3lbs, initially with the lower honey amount I was sitting at a 1.048 or ~6%.

1/4/25 - Fermentation is **very** active, added 1/4 tsp of Fermaid-O nutrient, worried that it will bubble over so I'm glad I've set the carboy in a Rubbermaid bin.

1/5/25 - Added 1/4 tsp of fermaid-o, decided to try and stir it, absolutely should not have. The mixture foamed up and i lost maybe 1/4 cup of it in total.

1/6/25 - Added another 1/4 tsp of fermaid-o, just swirled it this time, i need to read up on degassing

1/7/25 - Added final nutrient addition, 1/4 tsp fermaid-o. Still haven't read up on degassing.
