**1/3/25** - Started brew, initial gravity reading 1.094

Actually used 1.8lbs peaches though some of that might be syrup because they were added from cans.

That puts the potential ABV at ~12% which after sweetening would put it around ~10%, close to the 1.10 plan. Needed to increase the honey from the 2 1/4 lbs scaled down from the original recipe to 3lbs, initially with the lower honey amount I was sitting at a 1.048 or ~6%.

**1/4/25** - Fermentation is **very** active, added 1/4 tsp of Fermaid-O nutrient, worried that it will bubble over so I'm glad I've set the carboy in a Rubbermaid bin.

**1/5/2**5 - Added 1/4 tsp of fermaid-o, decided to try and stir it, absolutely should not have. The mixture foamed up and i lost maybe 1/4 cup of it in total.

**1/6/25** - Added another 1/4 tsp of fermaid-o, just swirled it this time, i need to read up on degassing

**1/7/25** - Added final nutrient addition, 1/4 tsp fermaid-o. Still haven't read up on degassing.

**1/9/25** - the sanitizing liquid in the airlock evaporated a bit so i put in more filtered water.

**1/11/25** - fermentation has definitely slowed, only been fermenting a week so if the [[Second Attempt|blackberry second attempt]] is anything to go off of it needs another 5 to 7 days.

After looking around more online I think I'm going to need to add more tanin in future batches, since the canned peaches don't have skins, maybe just double the black tea.

**1/15/25** - Racked the mead to another vessel and started stabilizing, ending gravity 0.996, which means as it stands right now the mead is at 12% ABV.

On tasting I didn't really get much peach flavor, I've seen someone backsweeten their peach mead with [Peach Nectar Jumex](http://jumexinternational.com/peach-nectar/) and I want to try that but I might boil out some of the water to try and get it down to a syrup.
