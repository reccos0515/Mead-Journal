12/21/24 - Added an extra 1/2 lb honey changed recipe, Initial gravity 1.106

12/27/24 - has been actively fermenting for a week, whether that's because of following or the higher starting gravity is unclear, planning to take a measurement and rack to a new vessel once it slows down more, also removing fruit at that point.

Should I add spices? Cinnamon nutmeg and cloves come to mind.

1/2/25 - new reading 0.998 so basically dry, I think the fruit is still releasing sugars that are being fermented.Â 

Based on sg calc it should be at 14.18%

Added Campden tablet ~5pm

1/3/25 - Added Potassium Sorbate at 6:30 pm, also racked again, was able to separate out a lot of the dead yeast

1/4/25 - Added 17 total ounces of liquid while backsweetening, 10 ounces of honey 7 of hot water. Going to let it sit a few days before bottling.

Final ABV 12.4%
