Use the [[Resources|Tosna calculator]] for further nutrient additions

##### Backsweetening
 - Backsweetening will basically always be a matter of personal taste, use a turkey baster and a shot glass to take samples while sweetening. I personally go at 1/2 cup of honey per addition when using a gallon sized fermenter.

1. Add 1/2 cup honey to pyrex measuring cup
2. Add 1/4 to 1/2 cup boiling water to the measuring cup
3. Gently stir until they're combined
4. Add the mixture to the fermenting vessel and stir to combine
5. Taste, asses and repeat if necessary
