   After very active fermentation beginning day 2 it slowed down a fair amount by day 5, it's not done fermenting but clearly it's already fermented a lot.

Lessons Learned
 - Wasted a lot of mead attempting to rack to a temporary vessel and clean the primary, bought new fermenting vessels to solve that problem.
 - For back sweetening add the honey to a measuring cup with equal parts warm/boiling water and stir, makes the honey combine with the mead **way** better

This was my favorite batch I've made so far as of 1/2/25 lovely flavor lots of body and mouthfeel, I didn't get to let it combine very long before drinking through it all, would really like to let the next attempt age and see how that changes things.
