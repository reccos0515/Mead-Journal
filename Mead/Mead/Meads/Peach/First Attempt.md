1/3/2025 - Started brew, initial gravity reading 1.094

Actually used 1.8lbs peaches though some of that might be syrup because they were added from cans.

That puts the potential ABV at ~12% which after sweetening would put it around ~10%, close to the 1.10 plan. Needed to increase the honey from the 2 1/4 lbs scaled down from the original recipe to 3lbs, initially with the lower honey amount I was sitting at a 1.048 or ~6%.
