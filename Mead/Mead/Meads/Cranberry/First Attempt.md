12/3/24 - Stating Gravity 1.056

12/15/24 - Second Reading 0.998

With backsweetening the final ABV is probably around 7% but I'm taking measurements out of my memory for this one, was a bit of a rushed batch for the holidays.

Starting gravity was definitely lower than the Blackberry, looking at the amount of honey added that makes sense. Definitely had a lighter flavor and was a big hit with extended family. I want to target 10-13% with the next attempt, aim for 1.100 to 1.110 starting gravity next time.
